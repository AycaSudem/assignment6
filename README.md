# Assignment 6 – Post Dashboard (React + Vite)

This project was developed as **Assignment 6** for the Web Programming course.  
The application is a simple **Post Dashboard** built with **React** and **Vite**, demonstrating component-based architecture, state management with `useReducer`, and data fetching from an external API.

---

##  Project Description

The application fetches a list of posts from an external API and displays them in a dashboard format.  
Users can filter posts by title using a search input.

Main goals of this assignment:
- Practice React fundamentals
- Use hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useReducer`
- Organize code with a clean and modular folder structure
- Work with API-based data
